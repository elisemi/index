            <br> 1. In the Eye Magazine article John-Patrick Hartnett starts by stating the widespread access people have to computers nowadays. A consequence that was meant to be positive yet is seeming more negative. The fact that everyone has access,
            or the illusion of access makes opportunities scarcer. This is a feature not a bug. While everyone has superficial access that access is still limited. It is not the people or the designers who have gained this access necessarily. They don’t
            own the means of production. There are hegemonic brands such as Apple and Adobe that don’t leave any space for competition for other brands. They are also directly linked to the profession i.e. designers are expected to use Adobe software.
            The designers and workers use these tools without even being aware of how the tools work because they are not the creators of the software. This is becoming more and more apparent with how technology is progressing. A solution to this is for
            designers to use their own tools and be familiar with them. Paper.js is one of piece of software used as an example. Designers owning their own tools and knowing how they function is how designers can own the power. The alternative is antithetical
            to the idea of Open Source Software. OSP is a valuable platform for designers to publish their own works and tools for free for others to use. This cuts out the need to rely on tools from corporations such as Adobe.
            <br>
            <br> Becca Abbe’s article discusses the negative impact industrialization has on the planet. This relates to Hartnett’s article which documents technological growth and its negative impacts as opposed to its perceived benefits. IN Abbe’s article
            the issue of resource scarcity is brought up. The fact that earth’s resources are being drained every year. The issues happening in both articles can’t be fixed unless radical action is taken by not only individuals but organizations and businesses.
            The solution for saving finite resources given by technocrats and bureaucrats was to taken individual action such as reducing birth rates and consumption. This puts the entirety of the onus on powerless individuals who are not the ones to
            blame for the bulk of these issues in the first place. Abbe goes on to mention that the original utopian view of the web is not accurate, there is no separation between the web and the real world. Just like Hartnett’s article, Abbe disproves
            the notion that we have any control over technology. Also, the fact that users don’t understand how these technologies function. The solution given is like the previous article. People need to take technology into their own hands and be mindful
            of it. Demystifying things like coding for the average person is the way forward. Both articles offer utopian solutions that are based on educating oneself.
            <br>
            <br> 2. Scarcity is something that will affect most people. It will first impact me as a human before it impacts me as a designer. These issues will entail that reduce our use of resources. Resources that are either necessities or luxuries.
            Regular people unlike elites will always bear the brunt of these issues. The upper classes and corporations will continue to waste finite resources and exacerbate these problems. Quality of living would significantly decrease in the upcoming
            years to prevent and decrease the negative impacts caused by climate change. As a designer this means using fewer physical materials for one. There will also need to be more simplification and reduction to digital media. Something like NFTs
            would have to be gone with entirely for the energy they use. Designers will essentially be the gatekeepers of sustainability and resource preservation through new design ideas.</P>

            <br> 3. A lot of open-source software relates to coding and programming. That seems fitting since the origins of open source are in coding. Codes are easy to share and alter for free. One online open-source software that specifically shares
            different pieces of code is CodePen (Links to an external site.). CodePen is for posting and hosting codes for just about anything HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. CodePen has both a preview mode and an editor view where the code can be copied or
            edited and previewed in real time. The website is completely free to use. The part of CodePen that is open source is the code sharing by users, not necessarily the platform itself, like GitHub. A non-coding open-source downloadable software
            is Trelby (Links to an external site.) (Windows & Linux only). Trelby is a screenwriting software that is completely free. It is a great alternative to other writing software like Celtx or Final Draft. The third open-source software is also
            not coding related. It is a downloadable video editing software called Shotcut (Links to an external site.). It is completely free and has enough tools to rival other paid video editing software. Shotcut is good for simple edits, it is not
            ideal for very intricate video editing or special effects. It is also easy to use compared to other free and paid programs, making it more accessible.
            <br>
            <br> All these programs enable creators to create their own work that can be shared and/or utilized by others. All the work I have put out thus far are public and are not paywalled. I hope to put out creative commons work in the future.

    <h2>Reading Discussion 3</h2>

        <P>
            <br>1. In Olia Lialina’s article “Turing Complete User” a universal user is someone who can complete a task in software that is not specifically meant to complete that task in. An example that is used is typing an article in an email client,
            rather than a writing software such as Microsoft Word. I think this is pretty accurate. While there are apps and software made for specific tasks, people will still find other uses for them. Social media sites for instance are used for more
            than they’re indented. Websites like Reddit and Twitter are used to disseminate news more than news platforms themselves. Laurel Schwulst has many reasons for advocating personal websites over platforms. One of the biggest ones is that having
            a personal website allows for authorial control, where a platform does not allow this. The structure of a personal website can also be as customized as the content. A universal user can utilize the personal website for any purpose and customize
            it as they please without the limitations and advertisements of platforms.
            <br>
            <br> 2. I consider myself a user. I tend to use apps the way I see fit, not necessarily how they’re intended. I’m not a fan of bespoke, curated software. I think it’s impossible for a program to only be used one way anyways. Also no one knows
            how computers or technology function anymore because of the convenience in user experience these days. As Lialina states “An effort must be made to educate the users about themselves. There should be understanding of what it means to be a
            user of an ‘all purpose automatic digital computing system’.” People are better off being more aware of how the apps and technology they use functions. The internet is described as a “web”; however, I believe the internet is more like a rhizome.
            Rhizomes are horizontally growing stems of a plant that shoot out roots. A spider web is all connected and orderly whereas a rhizome is chaotic and disconnected, with no end in sight.
